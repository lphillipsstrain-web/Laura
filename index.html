      <h2>About</h2>

      <p class="about-intro">
        I move through the world as a learner, an artist, a systems thinker, and a modern heathen.
        My practice threads together code, clay, pigment, and light. Variable mediums all give me
        different ways to feel the world and make sense of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve always held a steady commitment to sustainability—environmental, social, and economic.
        It shapes how I think about materials, communities, and the systems around us. That
        perspective continues to guide my choices, in both art and work: use what’s already here,
        move carefully, and look for approaches that help people and places endure.
      </p>

      <p>
        My professional life has long centered on understanding complexity and making it navigable
        for others. My work was rooted in listening closely, setting clear expectations, and building
        resilient structures so other people could move more easily through muddled systems. That
        instinct hasn’t changed, but the tools have.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lately, I’ve been drawn toward questions of digital safety, infrastructure, and how people
        behave inside the systems they rely on. I’m exploring how digital landscapes echo the physical
        ones I love. I'm studying how people, systems, and unseen forces influence one another. It’s a
        quiet thread in my life, not the whole tapestry.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m also an autistic woman rebuilding a life after burnout. This site holds all the threads
        I’m weaving back together: the everyday and the esoteric, the tactile and the digital, the
        quiet work of healing and the joyful work of creating something beautiful.

      <p>
        I’m drawn to the places where stone, water, fields, and forests tangle together. The
        quiet thresholds that feel half in this world and half in another.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are some of the scenes and textures I keep returning to: deserted paths, worn edges, 
        and the way light clings to moss and mist.
